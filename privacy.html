   <ul>
     <li><h4>Notice</h4>
       I care very deeply about Online privacy, and not in a Google kind of "Oh, we care deeply about your privacy but we're going to build a whole line of Linux laptops and put them in schools to turn children into data farms" kind of way. I grew up using the Internet, starting with the dial-up connection through Academic Planet when I was nine years old, all the way to the current stage of the Internet where you can never be sure who is trying to sell your data to someone to make a quick buck. The Internet has been part of my life for as long as I can remember, I was there in the early days, and I don't plan on leaving any time soon.
        <br><br>
       This policy exists on my site for two reasons:
         <ol class="lvl2">
           <li>For transparency. I don't even really have any mechanism for collecting data on this website (excluding the bug-report and contact forms that will collect email addresses and names, if you choose to include that information; and the persistent footer ad-powered by Google that is going to function like any other Google product, sorry, but there's nothing I can really do about that). However it's important to be that I be as clear and transparent as possible about the function of my site. This site exists to share my work and products with people who may be interested in it. This website is not now, and will never be a data farm.</li>
           <li>For legal purposes. A majority of states in the U.S. where I'm based require a privacy policy on a number of different types of websites, and the laws very wildly from country to country. I want my site to be available in as many countries and territories as possible, so it just seems like a good idea to try and make sure I'm in compliance with as many laws as possible.</li>
         </ol><br>
         Also, just to be clear, I wrote this policy myself in as clear of language as I could. I didn't go to Legal Zoom and try to hire someone to take care of this for me. It's very important to me that this be as brief, and as simple to understand as possible. However, if you have any questions, you can always use the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page to get in touch.
     </li>
     <li><h4>Opting In & Out of Data Collection</h4>
       Opting out of data collection on my site is very, very easy. My default, I am not tracking anything. As mentioned in the <a href="#notice"> notice section  </a>, the only data-collection that is spear-headed by me is the collection of names, and basic contact info via my contact forms. If you wish to withhold this information from me, that is completely understandable, and it is not required to interact with the site in any way, or to submit forms on the site.
      <br><br>
       I sell some merchandise on this website. The easiest way that I have found to make this happen is through third-party services that print these items on demand and then ship them to customers with relativity short turn around time. The website I use is Teepublic, who's privacy policy can be found <a href="https://www.teepublic.com/privacy_policy" target="_blank">here</a>. But it seems to me that the main concern here is mis-handling of credit card information. To combat that I have yet another piece of handy software to help you out. <a href="https://privacy.com" target="_blank">Privacy</a> will generate a dummy card that can be used for one-time purposes. Even if these websites have the worst security in the world, which I'm confident they don't (that award will always go to Equifax), there's no real credit-card information to be compromised.
     </li>
     <li><h4>Secutiry</h4>
     I collect email addresses and names <strong>ONLY</strong> so that I can follow-up about whatever you were using the contact form for. I have a bug report form and a general contact form. Both send your data and messages to a secure, encrypted email server, powered by <a href="https://protonmail.com">Proton Mail</a>. I will reply to these forms if necessary via the same encrypted email server, and then delete (not archive, but fully delete) the emails when they are taken care of. I keep a record of any information submitted, completely off line so that anyone who submits information to my site can retrieve that data and/or request that it be deleted. If you have any questions about his process, please direct you inquires to the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.
     </li>
     <li><h4>Accessing Your Data</h4>
     I think that this is kind of saying exactly the same thing that the security section is. But the guide I'm looking at says to make sure that I include at least these four sections. If you have sent any data into my website at any point in time, I don't have it. I don't store any information about anyone, ever.
   </li>
