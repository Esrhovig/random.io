       <ul>
         <li><h4>Introduction</h4>
           I spent a lot of time researching how to properly write a terms of service thing, and frankly it was just really complicated and I didn’t want to spend a ton of time fishing through what I felt was mostly just random garbage. I didn’t mind doing the privacy policy, it made a lot of sense and was really easy to write because I understand why it was important. But honest this seems like a big waste of time & I’m honestly still not sure if I even need this on my website. None the less, I’ll make an effort.
         </li>
         <li><h4>Privacy</h4>
           The one fairly straight-forward guide that I found online did say that I should dedicate a section to privacy. That really doesn’t make any sense, because even in that guide, they acknowledged that pretty much everyone who goes to the trouble of doing a Terms of Service will also have a separate <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. I have a separate Privacy Policy, so just click the link in the last sentence.<br><br>
           However, I will go over the main stuff one more time:
           <ol class="lvl2">
             <li>
               I don’t really have any mechanism to gather data from users on my website, but there are a few spots where users may knowingly give me information as part of a contact form or a bug report of something.
             </li>
             <li>
               This information will never be sold, shared, or even really looked at by me. I keep a record of this information (for reasons mentioned in the Privacy Policy), but all that information is stored on a secure server, and is delivered using and encrypted email account.
             </li>
           </ol>
         </li>
         <li><h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
                 Again, this seems like it would be kind of pointless on my site, as it’s not really a “service” the way that a lot of website’s are, but it can’t hurt to be safe. I do make some content available to download, so if that content goes down or whatever, don’t sue me. Apparently that’s a thing that can happen if you skip this section, IDK I’m just doing what is said on the website.
                  <br><br>
                 I host my website myself, and I think I do a pretty good job keeping my server up and running, but it’s not like issues can’t arise. If web traffic spikes in a big way, unexpectedly or something, or for any number of other reasons, it’s totally possible that my site could go down or start functioning poorly. So again, don’t sue me if that happens or whatever.
         </li>
         <li><h4>Intellectual Property </h4>
           I’m kind of just copy & pasting and putting it through my dumb guy filter, not a lawyer thing here but:
            <br><br>
           By using my site you acknowledge that the content of this website is subject to copyright & should only be used for research, and viewing, and stuff like that. Please don’t copy, reproduce, reproduce, or commercially exploited in all or in part. I don’t really care if people use my stuff for reference or.. well, really I don’t care so much if you use it at all. Just, you know, don’t rip it off in a super tacky way and then get bigger than me online so it looks like I’m the one that copied you.
         </li>
         <li><h4>Advertising and Endorsements</h4>
           Sometimes I have a banner ad in the footer of my website. It’s always a Google ad. If you have any question hit them up for that. Google’s gonna be Google so I’m sure they’re doing some data collection, sorry (that’s why I kind of keep changing my mind about putting ads on my site). But sometimes the ad is there, so it can’t hurt to mention it.
         </li>
         <li><h4>C.O.P.A.</h4>
           My website isn’t a social network, and doesn’t really have any social features for people to mess with. That being said, there is a law, at least in the United States, COPA (The Child Online Protection Acts) that protects minors online. The biggest part of this law requires that no one under 13 is allowed to join these social media sites. I don’t know how that applies to my website, but whatever. If you’re under 13, hell if you’re under 40 and using the internet to talk to people you’ve never met online, it can’t hurt to be really careful. There’s nothing easier than going to the 60th page of Google Images for “cute guy” or “cute girl” to steal a quick profile photo.
         </li>
         <li><h4>Payment Terms</h4>
                 My website is free to use. I make money through the ad that’s sometimes in the footer and merch, if you buy that stuff (a few people actually do). I’m not planning on ever putting and part of my website behind a pay-wall, or charging for anything, so have fun and I hope my stuff helps you out somehow.
         </li>
         <li><h4>Termination</h4>
                 This also felt like a section that wasn’t super important for me. No one makes and account to use my site, so it’s not like I’m going to be killing accounts if someone does something stupid. I mean, you can limit access to IP Addresses or locations or whatever, but I’m pretty sure if you just turn on a VPN it will bypass that, so it seems pointless. I can’t really imagine a situation where I would take any kind of action to limit someone’s access to my site, but if that situation that I can’t imagine does come up in the future, don’t get mad about it. I’m pretty sure you’d be able to find a way around almost anything that I would do, but I still might feel like I need to give it a try anyway.
         </li>
         <li><h4>Notification of Changes</h4>
                 The Terms of Service is subject to change over time, but the most current version is always going to found right here, and can be accessed by adding “/terms” to the end of my domain name at any time.
         </li>
         <li><h4>YouTube</h4>
                 This doesn’t apply to my website at all, but I wanted to talk about comment moderation on my YouTube channel just a little bit. YouTube gives YouTube channel quite a bit of control over comments and honestly I don’t really use them. Actually a lot of the time that I spend sifting through the comment moderation stuff is just letting through comments that YouTube plucked out as “potentially inappropriate”.
                   <br><br>
                 That being said, I take kind of a Twitter approach to comment moderation (or at least the approach that they claim they take, I honestly haven’t looked into enough to make a serious judgement). Basically jokes are fine, and language is fine, or whatever else. I generally try to make my content pretty safe for anyone (with a few exceptions), and I do appreciate anyone who does the same in the comment section. But I will never sensor anyone without a good reason. If however, someone is shown to be repeatedly harassing, or making everyone else’s time difficult online; I don’t really have a problem with plucking out those comments, and/or banning a user (I’m actually not sure if I can straight up ban a specific user from commenting on my videos, but that seems like the best way to go forward in that kind of situation).
                   <br><br>
                 I also care a lot about spam. Pretty much nothing will get a user banned (if that’s something I can do) faster than spamming up the comment section. If I’m making a video about some cool thing on OSX and you start posting links to Burger King coupon’s, I hate you. But also I’m going to delete your comment.
                   <br><br>
                 Generally speaking, I want as many people to share and comment in the section as possible. I’m a firm believer that anyone should be able to contribute, and that these contributions make my content better. More than once I’ve made a video about something, and then someone else has come along later and added content in the comment section that made the whole process better. I’m never going to delete criticism or anything like that. So feel free to go there, but honestly I’ve heard most if it before: I ramble too long before getting to the video start, or there’s weird stuff you can hear in the background. I don’t know what to tell you, I live with other people, and I’m not the best video host in the world. If you can put up with the flaws and get something out of the video, great, I’m glad to have helped. If you didn’t, and just want to leave a comment, go for it, I’ll keep working at it and maybe one day we’ll get there.
         </li>
         <li><h4>Contact Information</h4>
                 We’ve arrived at the most pointless section. Use the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>. This is dumb.
         </li>
