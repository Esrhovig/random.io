  <h3>Known Issues</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Redirects</h4>
      I've had a few different domain names that I've used for my website, mainly just two: "makc.co" & "mackenziecriswell.com". Currently, and permanently (unless something crazy happens) I use "makc.co" as the main domain name. That being said, I do still own "mackenziecriswell.com", and don't have any plans to let it expire, or sell it, or anythign. So, every link that was generated from "mackenziecriswell.com" should redirect to it's proper loaction on "makc.co". However, this isn't a perfect science, so if you're experiencing any kind of issue with the redirects, or are just having trouble traking an older link, feel free to use the bug report from below.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Downloadable Content</h4>
      Connected in-part to my issues with switching domain names, a lot of people have had trouble finding links to a few pieces of content that I've made available for download on my website. This time around, I actually do have a really good fix that should last forver. Everything that I've ever made available for download has a new home <a href="downloads.html">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Dark Mode</h4>
      To avoid any confusion I wanted to explain how the dark mode works on my website. Dark mode is pretty new to the internet, at least on a mass scale, but it's a really great feature for anyone, like me, who is frequently working overnight. Conventionally the way that this feature has been implemented is via a button somewhere on a site. YouTube, Reddit, Twitter, and many more use this method. <br><br>
      However, I find that method to be quite <em>clunky</em>. These sites store data about you to remember your preference about dark modes, so anytime you get a new computer, open a different broswer, or just clean out website data in your default browser that data's gone and your blinded at 2AM. But even with this data being stored, and using the same browser everytime I go to a website, I've had non-stop reliability issues. <br><br>
      But, beyond bugs, I don't view this as the optimal way to switch to a <em>dark mode</em>. Most modern desktop (and increasingly mobile) operating systems have clued into this, with Windows 10 & MacOS recently adding system wide dark mode functionality, and most Linux distros (at least the ones I frequent) having implemented this feature years ago. A user flips one switch in an OS, and all programs, menus, file explorers, everything goes dark. But then you open up a broswer and travel back in time, having to push buttons on every single individual website to enable dark mode.<br><br>
      But, <em>this is the cool part</em>, it actually can be much easier. With one of the updates to Safari after they enabled dark mode in MacOS, Apple introduced a feature that would allow web designers to enable dark mode along with the OS. When a user switces to dark mode, or light mode, the website follows. No one has to restart a browser, or even reload a page, it just happens instantly. This is the technology that I've gone with to enable my site's dark mode. By default eveyone sees the dark mode, so if you're on an unsupported browser or operating system, dark mode is all you'll ever see. But when you do move over to a supported system, my sites color theme will follow your OS preferences without anyone ever having to do anything other than type in the URL.<br><br>
      Of course the biggest problem with something like this, is that it is very new, and not incredibly well supported technology. Upon launch it was only spported on MacOS, in Safari. But it has expanded to a fair amount of other browsers. Google Chrome, the unfortuante behemoth that it is still does not support the functionality (at the time of writing). However, I would be shocked if the technology isn't implemented in Apple's upcomming iOS 13 release. So, were in kind of weird spot. iOS 13 should cover a huge chunk of the mobile users online, and assuming that Chrome does implement the feature at some point, that will just leave Microsoft to follow suit, or build thier own similar technology. <br><br>
      Admitedley, for the time being however, this solution is a tiny bit janky. I'm only comfortable with it at all because I'm confident that most of my site's users are currently able to use this feature, or will be able to in the near future. That being said, if enough people really want a manual dark mode switcher, and leave a feature request above, I'll go ahead and add it. There's no reason that both methods can't be built into a site and function fine. I jsut skipped over it on the initial build of my website, because I thought the button looked kind of tacky when I was testing it out.
