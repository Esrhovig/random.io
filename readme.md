This is the repository for my personal Website. This websites main goal is to serve as a hub, to link to all of my other social networks and on-line projects; to serve as a portfolio for my Motion Graphics and Graphic Design work; and finally to provide download links to content I've made over the years.

After years of working with [Adobe Muse](http://muse.adobe.com/), [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/), and a number of other web design services; I decided to re-write my website myself, in an effort to learn some web design. I settled on using super basic web technologies to try and accomplish this: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. No frameworks, no Squarespace just really simple web design. 

I've been documenting the entire process in an ongoing series on my [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/makccr).
