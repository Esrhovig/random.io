This is the repository for my personal Website. This websites main goal is to serve as a hub, to link to all of my other social networks and on-line projects; to serve as a portfolio for my Motion Graphics and Graphic Design work; and finally to provide download links to content I've made over the years. 

As far as the technical specifications here, there's noting super advanced or crazy; in fact, I'm not really a very good web designer at all, I just don't like Squarespace. I set a goal when designing my site to not use and frameworks or JavaScript libraries, or anything else. The only tools I've used to build this site are HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript for mobile menus. It's not great, and the actual code probably isn't efficient or whatever, but it does work. If you are super interested in how I built the site, I do actually have a descent collection of videos about the design process on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWh6YtclgTAzReTASc4uSKw).
