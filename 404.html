        <p class="card404">There are a number of different issues that could result in your landing on this page, but most commonly the issue is my fault. I've always maintained and upkept my site on my own, and I haven't always been very good at it. So, I've created a lot of broken links over the years. Most commonly visitors find themselves here when looking for <em>download links</em>, and if that is the case for you, all such links have a new and <em>permanent</em> home <a href="downloads.html">here</a>. If that's not the case for you, you can proceeed to the home page, or leave a bug report below. </p>
        <p class="sub">*You may also have eneded up here after following a link to one of many blog posts I've written, and there's nothing I can do to help you there. I've experimented with that format a lot, but at least for now, that section of my website is dead.</p>
