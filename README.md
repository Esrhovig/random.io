This is the entire directory for my personal website. I am a freelance motion graphics designer & web developer. I recently redesigned my website from the ground up to be responsive, and to include an intuitive dark mode, as well as a few other special features that I care about.

#### Dark Mode

I'm using Apple's solution for dark mode on this site, which involves using a media query to have your website's theme follow the system wide theming. Not a ton of browsers support this functionality yet, it basically just works in Safari & Firefox on OSX, and will work in Safari on iOS 13 when that's released later this year; but hey, it's my personal website, if I can't play around with it here, where can I?

There's not a ton left to say really, feel free to check it out and fork if you feel like it.
